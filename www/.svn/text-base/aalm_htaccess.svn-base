## This .htaccess file helps direct requests to the appropriate
## files and directories.  The top piece here will attempt to 
## detect the environment and set some defaults.  A place to 
## create overrides in further below.
##
## For this to work, you will need to create a symbolic link
## to your eCash module as ecash_root within this directory.
## e.g.: ln -s /virtualhosts/ecash3.0 ecash_root
