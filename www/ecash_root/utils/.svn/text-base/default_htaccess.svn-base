## This .htaccess file helps direct requests to the appropriate
## files and directories.  The top piece here will attempt to 
## detect the environment and set some defaults.  A place to 
## create overrides in further below.
##
## For this to work, you will need to create a symbolic link
## to your eCash module as ecash_root within this directory.
## e.g.: ln -s /virtualhosts/ecash3.0 ecash_root


## CUSTOMER SPECIFIC
SetEnv ECASH_CUSTOMER %%%CUSTOMER_SHORT%%%
SetEnv ECASH_CUSTOMER_DIR %%%CUSTOMER_DIR%%%
SetEnv ECASH_WWW_DIR %%%ECASH_WWW%%%

## This is how you can override the mode for your local machine
SetEnv ECASH_EXEC_MODE %%%EXEC_MODE%%%


## GENERAL 
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

## Set the environment variables for the customer so redirected
## requests to the main ecash module can determine which
## configuration file to load and for which customer.  Custom
## overrides such as the ECASH_EXEC_MODE can be defined here.

## these rules will definitely need some massaging...
